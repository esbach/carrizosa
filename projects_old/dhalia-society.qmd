::: {.project-intro}
The Dhalia Society is a modern floral design studio that brings artistic vision and botanical expertise to events and spaces throughout the Bay Area. Our collaboration focused on capturing the essence of their distinctive styleâ€”bold, organic arrangements that blur the line between nature and art. Through careful composition and natural lighting, we created a visual narrative that showcases both the intricate details and the overall impact of their work.
