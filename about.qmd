## ABOUT

Born in Colombia and raised in Ecuador, San Francisco–based photographer Cristina Carrizosa blends her deep-rooted passion for storytelling with more than fifteen years of experience behind the lens. Her photography reveals the feeling of a space—its rhythm, light, and design—through imagery that is both authentic and artfully composed. She collaborates with brands, designers, and hospitality teams to create visual stories that invite and inspire.

Cristina's background in advertising shapes her approach to visual storytelling, helping her translate creative concepts into evocative imagery. She has worked with global brands including Marriott, Tiffany & Co., Adidas, and Amazon Kindle, among others. Her work has been featured in the American Photographic Artists' Top 100 Exhibit in San Francisco and honored with the Silver Award for Enhanced Photography from the Association for Communication Excellence.
